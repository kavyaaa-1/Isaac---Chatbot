# Isaac

Issac is a deep learning based inquisitive chatbot that acts as a virtual student. This is built using Python.

## How it works
Isaac is a smart inquisitive chatbot which actively listens, then ask questions about what the user has been speaking about.
It classifies the information that the user has been speaking about according to the tags present in the dataset.
It also listens to the answers that the user is giving.
The chatbot will first listen to our information then classify the intent of the data using deep neural networks and intent classification models.
We have created our own extensive dataset for intent classification and then used it for asking questions related to that topic .
